# Metrics UI Feature Backlog

This file tracks planned UI features for the hybrid (agent + human) workflow.

## Agent-Driven Controls
- Annotations: vertical tick markers with optional labels; jump to next/previous marker.
- Metric focus modes: solo a metric or auto-compare the same metric across captures.
- Presets: save/load metric selections + window + speed as named presets.
- Agent snapshots: export current view state (metrics, window, annotations) as JSON.

## Analysis Aids
- Deviation overlays: diff series (absolute/percent) for paired captures.
- Coverage badges: show numeric coverage next to metrics to surface invalid picks.
- Event overlays: accept a separate JSONL stream to render annotations on the chart.
